Besides a working JRE, ant, and a copy of Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, here are a few environment variables that you want to set before SCNTreeViewer can work.

build.xml: STANFORD_CORENLP_HOME

SCNTreeViewer.sh: STANFORD_CORENLP_HOME

Now you can use "ant" to compile SCNTreeViewer, and "SCNTreeViewer.sh" helps to invoke it.

Enjoy!
